<div class="header">How it works</div>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript works on a coordiate basis, where the origin is in the top left corner of the window, where the X axis is the horizontal axis with increases as you go to the right and the Y axis is the vertical axis which increases as you go down.</li>
  <li>Pixels are small, so here we have made 10 pixel equal to 1 step.</li>
  <li>To move 10 steps, we increase the pixel count by 10 x 10 = 100</li>
  <li>To move in the scratch direction 180, we increase the y coordinate</li>
  <li>We save the JQuery sprite object in a variable since we use it more than once. Its a good practice to prefix JQuery variables with a "$".</li>
  <li>We obtain the current position of the sprite using the JQuery position function</li>
  <li>We then use JQuery's css function to update the sprite's coordinates</li>
  <li>You can also use a JQuery animate function instead of a JQuery css function to replicate Scratch's glide--why don't you try it out!</li>
</ul>
